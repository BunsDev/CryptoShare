### Project Vision

The purpose of the app would be to provide users with a unified interface they can use to track and manage any part of their finances. From cryptocurrencies, to stocks, to budgeting, mortgages and taxes, the app would have helpful features. The app would avoid being too complex to navigate by having separate sections for each tool, while also having a dashboard page to combine most of the data and present it in a readable and useful manner. By being cross-platform, open source, privacy centered as well as self-hosted, the project aims to put the user first by giving them complete control of their data, while allowing them to verify for themselves that the software is safe. 

The problem the app intends to solve is that most financial tools and services require users to sign up to a third party website or app that would have access to its users' personal data. Furthermore, while companies providing these services usually have a privacy policy that states user data is protected, they are still liable to data breaches or they may even voluntarily sell or share user data. Since their systems are proprietary, users cannot verify that the code is safe, and they cannot truly know what's going on in the background. Entities that provide such proprietary services are common when it comes to cryptocurrency, which was always intended to be private and trustless, but they're even more prevalent in stocks. Open source tools for income management, taxes, mortage calculators etc. are also rare to find, and there's no way for users to verify that their data isn't being collected or otherwise sold. Such apps are also currently usually separate from one another, requiring users to constantly manually update their data across multiple apps. CryptoShare would allow them to manage nearly every aspect of their financial data in one secure and private place.
