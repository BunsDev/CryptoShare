### Project Vision

After searching the Google Play Store and Apple App Store, it became clear that apps that offer the ability to manage your finances, track your income, and help you budget don't take into account your investments, and if they do, they simply ask you for your profits and losses, and use that to calculate how much money you have. By doing it this way, a lot of potential automation is left on the table, and the user has to manually update this information, and keep track of their investments. The apps that track their investments are usually separate from the income and budgeting apps, and are also usually either for tracking cryptocurrencies or stocks rather than both. My solution is an app called CryptoShare, where investors can track their cryptos and stock shares they hold, and include both of these when it comes to income management and budgeting. The app would offer them a way to track the value of their assets, view market data, and record transactions. Aside from this, they can set up recurring events that provide them with income, such as cryptocurrency mining and staking, or stock dividends paid out to them for holding certain assets. In addition, the API and all user data is self-hosted, and the app would be completely open-source. Existing solutions are often proprietary, and users have no way to verify their data is actually safe, and considering the confidentiality of financial data, itâ€™s important users can retain control of their data. By collating all this information, the main functionality of the app can be used, which is a chat bot with Natural Language Processing capabilities that is able to help the user manage their finances. It can record transactions, provide price updates and alerts, or simply tell the user if they can afford to buy a pizza for the weekend while taking their income, spending habits, and overall net worth into account. The goal is to outsource financial stress to an AI.
